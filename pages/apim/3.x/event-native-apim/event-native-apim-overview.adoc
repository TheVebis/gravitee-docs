== Event-driven asynchronous APIs

Most developers are familiar with synchronous APIs, where the client sends a request to a server, and the server sends a response back. Every time the client needs new data, it has to send a request. You can think of synchronous APIs as a 'client pull' model. RESTful APIs are a type of synchronous API.

In contrast, asynchronous APIs are event-driven and allow you to stream data. Asynchronous APIs can use callbacks, such as webhooks, if the requested data is not available at the time of the request. You can think of asynchronous APIs as a 'server push' model. AsyncAPIs are a type of asynchronous API.

For more information about event-driven architectures and asynchronous APIs, see the link:https://www.asyncapi.com/[AsyncAPI website].

== What is "event-native API management"?

With the rise of cloud computing, many vendors started to build their solutions for the cloud. Rather than taking on-premises software and converting it to work as SaaS, it was built from the ground to to be cloud-based. These solutions are said to be cloud-native.

Event-native API management is similar. Rather than taking a synchronous API management solution and converting it to handle event-driven APIs, an event-native API management solution is built from the ground up to handle event-driven APIs.

== Gravitee's event-native API management

Gravitee's API management solution is event-native, and can support all asynchronous, streaming, and event-driven API use cases. Of course, Gravitee's API management solution also supports synchronous use cases.

Gravitee can act as a bridge between synchronous and asynchronous environments.

For example, Gravitee can subscribe to a Kafka topic and then allow filtered HTTP GET subscriptions from clients as shown in the following diagram.
