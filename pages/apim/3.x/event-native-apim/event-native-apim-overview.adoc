== What is "event-natve API management"?

With the rise of cloud computing, many vendors started to build their solutions for the cloud. Rather than taking on-premesis software and converting it to work as SaaS, it was built from the ground to to be cloud-based. These solutions are said to be cloud-native.

Event-native API managment is similar. Rather than taking a synchronous API management solution and converting it to handle event-driven APIs, an event-native API management solution is built from the ground up to handle event-driven APIs.

== Gravitee's event-native API management

Gravitee's API management solution is event-native, and can support all asynchronous, streaming, and event-driven API use cases. Of course, Gravitee's API management solution also supports synchronous use cases.

Gravitee can act as a bridge between synchronous and asynchronos environments.

For example, Gravitee can subscribe to a Kafka topic and then allow filtered HTTP GET subscriptions from clients as shown in the following diagram.
