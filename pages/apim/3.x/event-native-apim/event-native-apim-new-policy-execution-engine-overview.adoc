== Future planned features

The GA release of the V4 policy execution engine will provide the following additional features:

* Advanced Kafka connector (as an EE feature).
* Support for more backend connector types, such as MQTT and Kinesis.
* A dual execution mode for SME.
* A new wrapper mechanism to make all V3 mode policies executable on the new engine.
* UI support for the new execution mode.
* Subscription message filtering, designed to filter messages when building an Async API. This feature can be used for Kafka and other use cases.
* GRAVITEE API security enhancements, including advanced anomaly detection (OpenAPI spec compliance), API inventory and lineage, and support for security ratings.
* Support for policy application at the message level for asynchronous APIs and event-driven APIs will enable the application of transformation logic at message level - for example, transforming the payload of each frame transiting on a Websocket connection. The following policies are currently planned for:
** XML to JSON: transform XML content to JSON content.
** XML/JSON and JSON/JSON message transformation.
** Serialization and deserialization capabilities for Avro and Protobuff.
