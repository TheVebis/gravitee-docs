This page describes how to install and run a Kafka cluster and AKHQ in Docker containers on `localhost`. AKHQ allows you to manage and view data inside your Kafka cluster

== Prerequisites

APIM must be running in Docker containers, as described in link:/apim/3.x/event_native_tutorials_apim.html[Installing APIM].

== Installing AKHQ

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file.
+
[code,bash]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tchiotludo/akhq/master/docker-compose.yml -O
----

2. Add the following lines to the end of `docker-compose.yml`.
+
[code,json]
----
networks:
  default:
    name: storage
----
+
These lines make AKHQ run on the `storage` Docker bridge network that was created when APIM was deployed.

3. Run `docker compose` to download and start all of the components.
+
[code,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

4. In your browser, go to `http://localhost:8086` to open the AKHQ UI.
