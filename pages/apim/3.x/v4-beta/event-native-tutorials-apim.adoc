This page describes how to install and run APIM in Docker containers on `localhost`.

== Prerequisites

Docker must be installed and running. For more information about installing Docker, see the link:{{'https://www.docker.com/' | relative_url }}[Docker website].

== Installing APIM

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file.
+
[code,bash]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-docker/master/apim/3.x/docker-compose.yml -O  
----
2. Open `docker-compose.yml` in a text editor and add the following line to `/services/gateway/environment` section if it is not already there.
+
[code,yml]
----
- gravitee_api_jupiterMode_enabled=true
----
+
This ensures that the gateway runs with its event-native features enabled.
3. In `docker-compose`, make sure that all the `APIM_VERSION` variables are set to `{APIM_VERSION:-3.20.0}`
+This ensures you are using the correct version of APIM.
3. Run `docker-compose` to download and start all of the components.
+
[code,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----
