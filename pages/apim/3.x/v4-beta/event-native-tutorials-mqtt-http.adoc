== Prerequisites 

Before running this tutorial, you must have:

* Set up Postman, as described in link:{{'/apim/3.x/event_native_tutorials_postman.html' | relative_url}}[Setting up Postman].
* The Gravitee API Management Gateway running in Docker, as described in link:{{'/apim/3.x/event_native_tutorials_apim.html' | relative_url}}[Installing APIM]. To confirm it is running, go to `http://localhost:8084`.
* HiveMQ running in Docker, as described in link:{{'/apim/3.x/event_native_tutorials_hivemq.html'| relative_url}}[Installing HiveMQ]. To confirm it is running, go to `http://localhost:8086`.

== Creating the API

1. In the `3.20 - POST to MQTT` collection, navigate to the "Create the API" `POST` request, and send it. You should receive the following response.
+
[code,json]
----
sample
----
+
The first key-pair value in the response specifies the unique ID of the API.
2. Copy the ID, and paste it into the api field in the environment file. 

_Note to Linus: This is a very simple example; future tutorials will have more complex examples here._

== Creating a keyless plan

1. Select the "Create an Open (Keyless) Plan" and send it. You should receive the following response.
+
[code,json]
----
sample
----

The first key-pair value in the response specifies the unique ID of the plan.
2. Copy the ID, and paste it into the plan field in the environment file. 

== Starting the API

1. Send the "Start API" POST request.

_Note to Linus: I will be putting various examples in here, such as posting content to MQTT and getting content from it._
